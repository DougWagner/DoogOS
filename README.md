#DoogOS

A work-in-progress operating system for x86 architecture.

Currently all it does is prints some text to the terminal.

The build script is horrible and I plan on changing that in the future.

Code is inspired by tutorials at wiki.osdev.com, but not identical (I TRIED to do my own thing based on the principles there)
